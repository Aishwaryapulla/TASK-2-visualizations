This project focuses on building an interactive visuals using Superstore data to uncover key business insights across sales, profit, discount impact, shipping, and customer behavior.
I started by designing simple but powerful visuals:
•	Bar and column charts to compare average discounts by category and region.
•	Line charts for tracking sales trends over time and understanding discount impact on quantity and profit.
•	Pie Chart were used to categorize sum of Sales by ship mode.
•	A Q&A visual enabled users to interact with the data using natural language, offering quick insights like top products, average shipping times, or customer counts by category.

•	Where are we making the most sales?
•	Which products are selling the most units?
•	How do discounts affect our profit and sales volume?
•	What shipping modes are used most frequently?
This structure helps users navigate and focus on the most relevant insights for their needs.
In the end, I created a clean, story-driven dashboard that brings raw data to life and supports faster, smarter decision-making. 🎯📊
