This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard using Superstore data to uncover key business insights across sales, profit, discount impact, shipping, and customer behavior.
We started by designing simple but powerful visuals:
1. Bar and column charts to compare average discounts by category and region.
2. Line charts for tracking sales trends over time and understanding discount impact on quantity and profit.
3. Pie Chart were used to categorize sum of Sales by ship mode.
4. A Q&A visual enabled users to interact with the data using natural language, offering quick insights like top products, average shipping times, or customer counts by category.

1. Where are we making the most sales?
2. Which products are selling the most units?
3. How do discounts affect our profit and sales volume?
4. What shipping modes are used most frequently?

This structure helps users navigate and focus on the most relevant insights for their needs.
In the end, we created a clean, story-driven dashboard that brings raw data to life and supports faster, smarter decision-making. 🎯📊
